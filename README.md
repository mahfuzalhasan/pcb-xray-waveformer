# Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning Segment Anything Model for PCB Inspection

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), recognized for its flexibility in semantic segmentation, has proven effective in segmenting a wide range of objects in natural images. However, it faces limitations when applied to the complex layouts of PCB X-ray images, struggling to accurately identify and segment the various components embedded in circuit designs. 
Addressing these challenges requires adapting SAM to handle the intricate structures and X-ray artifacts unique to PCBs, necessitating targeted modifications and optimization. In this work, we present a tailored approach for segmenting PCB components from X-ray images by using a version of SAM, enhanced through parameter-efficient fine-tuning and few-shot learning techniques. We propose specific adjustments to improve the modelâ€™s capacity to capture detailed spatial relationships and accurately segment individual components. 
Our approach emphasizes efficient adaptation of the SAM model to manage the unique features of PCB X-ray images.
